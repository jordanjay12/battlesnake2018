Pulling: git pull
Committing:
  1. git add .
  2. git commit -m "<message>"
  3. git push

BEFORE YOU PUSH/MERGE/REBASE, MAKE SURE YOU RUN git fetch -p and git pull on MASTER

All of the different branches that are available: git branch --all

Creating a new branch: git checkout -b "new branch name"

Switching to another branch: git checkout <branchName>
                             ex. git checkout master
                             
Updating "your" branch with the master branch:                             
                             git fetch -p (fetches all the changes from the remote repo)
                             git pull

                             switch back to your branch (git checkout branchName)
                             git rebase master - rebases everything that was on master
                             
Pushing to your local branch: git push -u origin <branchName>

To merge with the master:
  1. Switch over to the master branch
  2. git merge <branchName>
